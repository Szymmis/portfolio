    "I'm interested in developing web apps and pages with the use of the newest technologies for about four years. In my free time, I practicing my skills and broadening my knowledge about React.js by making projects that I put up on my Github. Endurance and determination help me in realizing certain goals. Furthermore, my experience with different languages allows me easier and more effective absorption of new techs. Familiarity with the English language is another advantage as it allows me to freely read documentations. My purpose is to earn commercial experience by working with professionals.",

React.js allowed me to keep this app small and simple but effective. Using Firebase I'm able to store different users dictionaries allowing them to use it on whatever device they wish to. As a user you can manage your set of words by adding or removing them as well as practising. With friendly and nice to look at UI, everyone should have fun using this web application!",

It's a very simple application allowing you to keep your daily tasks in one place, you can put them into categories so you always know where to find them. By using React Native I was able to develop my app on both Android and iOS devices with one code-base.",

So I started developing this app, by using Electron I'm able to use every tool that is available to desktop application programmers such as file system, etc. Using API enables me to offer users some special abilities when editing their filters such as fetching real-time game data from the web.",

I chose Commando when I was searching the web for some idea, as it's really fun to play fast-paced shooter. It was a really interesting project to do as I had to make everything from the ground-up. Moving, shooting, enemies and their AI, and many more. Despite having only one level it's a very engaging and hard game to play. You should give it a try!",
